# This is a comment in YAML and it doesn't allow for multi line comments
# YAMLis a key-value pair stuff like say
"Greeting": "Hello"

# YAML support collections like lists and maps

# List
"List of fruits":
 - apple
 - mango
 - banana
 - orange

# if you want to store the list in a single line without the indentation use
fruits": ["apple", "mango", "guava", "banana", "orange"] # still similar to the indentation version

# block but must obey the indentation
fruit": [
 "apple", 
 "mango", 
 "guava", 
 "banana", 
 "orange"
]

# for maps
person: {name: "name", age: 27, city: "Nairobi"} # maps representation in a single line

# maps with indentation 
test: {
 name: "test name",
 duration: 24,
 location: "cloud"
}

# Above is a block with indentation very important in syntax checking

# YAML is very strict and case sensitive; like Apple and apple are completely different

# Maps are key value paires


# YAML documents can be seperated by --- for example

---
# Second document begins here

---
# Third document begins here

---
# Nth document and so on

# and to end the document use ... as below
