# list
student: !!seq
 - name
 - registration number
 - date of registration
 - program
 - year of study
 - age
 - marks

# when some of the keys of the sequence are empty -> that type of sequence is known as sparse sequence
sparse sequence: !!seq
 - 
 - name
 - .nan
 - .inf # etc

# it is also possible to have nested sequence like list inside another list and many more
animals:
 # species of animals
 - fish:
   - tilapia

 - amphibians:
   - frog
   - salamanda
 
 - reptiles
   - crocodile
   - lizard

 - mammals:
   - human beings
   - lion
   - hippo


# maps - these are key value pairs: to specify the type we use !!map
groceries: !!map {
 tomatoes: 25,
 onions: 20,
 vegetable oil: 390 # and many more
}

# just like lists it is possible to have nested maps too by placing other maps inside the others
# we can also nest maps inside list and list inside maps and so on

# YAML supports complex data types like sequences (lists) and mappings (dictionaries)
# and it is possible to have a sequence of maps or a map of sequences
# or a sequence of sequences and so on

# similar representation can be done using indentation
